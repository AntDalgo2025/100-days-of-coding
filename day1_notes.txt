# Well the first day went by smoothly enough
# Learned Linux Command-Line and created a System Cleanup Script
# The code for it was simple enough to understand which is the goal of it
# Created the script with no issues
# Learned about If-else-fi statements, couple of bruises from it but
# got it working

# That's all, just got to figure out how this whole Git thing works.
