For Day 4 I learned how to build a monitoring tool.

Biggest take-away was understanding what JSON is and does. Along with argparse and socket.
JSON is crutial for storing logs and exchanging data. JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is widely 
used due to the human-readability and is easy to parse to other programming languages.

Argparse or argument parsing is a python module used for handling CLI arguments. It allows for arguments to pass
options dynamically instead of modifying the script. It helps with the flexability of a security tool when it 
takes in input like file paths, IP addresses, or modes. It is useful for automation, especially in penetration
testing or log analyis.

A socket allows for two devices to communicate to each other over a network. It enables client-server communication,
which is the foundation of a lot of security tools. In terms of cybersecurity, it is used for port scanning, network 
monitoring, and custom exploits. It can help create a custom network service for Pentesting. It powers
backdoor communication, packet sniffing and more.

As for the script its overall purpose is to conduct system monitoring and logging. It gathers and logs system information
, it uses psutil to monitor system metrics, logs the data for auditing and/or security monitoring, and possibly detect
anamolies or unusual activity.

There is room for improvement, such as incorporating a stop function. As it is now it continualy logs data to no end.
Adding to that is that there is no file rotation, which means it is all stored one file causing large file logs over
time. There is no alert system in place if resource usage is critically high. The files are stored in plain text so if
a threat actor were to gain access they can see the pattern usage of a system.
